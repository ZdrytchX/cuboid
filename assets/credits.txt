    TODO

       - a proper Helmet Mk2 texture

    CHANGELOG
Version  Release date
______________________________________________________________________________________________
0.1.3 - ZdrytchX's Branch
         ???
GAMEPLAY:
- Upp'd alien build time for important structures in response to complaints
- Upp'd human spawn build time to compensate for egg BT going up
- Dwn'd human reactor build time from 30 to 26 secs (felt like forever for some people)
- Upp'd alien OM BT from 20 secs to 24 secs (to restrict alien manouvreability)
- Temporarily fixed GPP armour system and upp'd goon pounce back to default (100 dmg), if I am
    correct dragoons should 3-hit kill larmours, 4-hit kill full-armoured and 5-hit kill bsuits
- Nerf'd Rant Trample (75 -> 56), but added a constant value (15) so it's more useful when charge
    meter is low, overall it does slightly more damage but less at the start)
- Buff'd Rant bomb versus players only (150 -> 200, versus structures is the same)
- Upp'd Rant Bomb Regen Rate (2 mins -> 1.5 mins)
- Brought Marauder walljump speed limit back to vanilla
- Capped cuboid volume to a million units cubed (100 unit sides)
- Reverted Zap to vanilla GPP (apparently he hadn't updated the git source and still had the 100 times per second taser style)

CLIENT:
- Finished off Hitsounds that wasn't accepted
    (sound/feedback/hit4.wav
    sound/feedback/hit8.wav
    sound/feedback/hit12.wav
    sound/feedback/hit25.wav
    sound/feedback/hit.wav [i.e. hit50.wav but ignore the 50, this sound is used for monotone mode]
    sound/feedback/hit75.wav
    sound/feedback/hit100.wav
    sound/feedback/hit125.wav
    sound/feedback/hit150.wav
    sound/feedback/hitcrit.wav [Used when you had lost more than 70% health in one chunk,
    i.e. lcannon])
- Added DoubleJumpSound (sound/feedback/doublejump.wav)


Version  Release date
______________________________________________________________________________________________
0.1.0    Sep 06 2013
GAMEPLAY:
- Based upon Cuboid 0.2.2 (note: the versioning in the original cuboid was different).
- Added Human Impregnation Mod.
- Jetpacks now need fuel to operate (buy ammo to refuel).
- Added a Jetpack fuel indicator (cg_fuelInfo* cvars to customize).
- Jumping uses fuel instead of stamina when possible (jetpack jumps).
- Implemented CPMA physics for everyone (both teams, all classes).
- Lucifer Cannon behaviour reverted to 1.1 (slow missiles, high firerate).
- Knockback values of Tesla Generators, Flame Throwers and Hives were decrased greatly 
- Aliens now build faster than Humans (all buildables).
- It is now possible to evolve near an enemy as long as he's not in the sight.
- Adv. Marauder now works like Quake 3's Lightning Gun (greatly increased fire rate, damage per second remains unchanged).
- Medkit now gives humans 15s long immunity to poison.
- Dodging was removed.
- Dragoon pounce damage lowered by 25%.
- Trample damage lowered by 33%.
- Added Biores (heals the user and grants a partial immunity to poison).
- Server operator can choose to limit the amount of buildings that can be built in an area
- Tyrants can drop bombs (regenerate at a Booster)
- Updated the tutorial system - now it turns itself on every update but displays help only about things that weren't in the last version
- A splash screen (with Cuboid logo and version) is now displayed every map load/restart. 
NON-GAMEPLAY:
- Jetpack now has new, less annoying sounds.
- Flamer sounds better.
- New Marauder zapping sounds.
